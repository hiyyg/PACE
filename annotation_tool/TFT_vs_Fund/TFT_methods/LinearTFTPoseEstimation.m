function [R_t_2,R_t_3,Reconst,T,iter]=LinearTFTPoseEstimation(Corresp,CalM)
%LINEARTFTPOSEESTIMATION Pose estimation of 3 views from corresponding 
% triplets of points using the linear TriFocal Tensor. 
%
%  The trifocal tensor is computed with an algebraic minimization of the
%  trilinearities using the triplets of correspondences. The essential
%  matrices are computed from the tensor and the calibration matrices and 
%  the orientations are extracted by SVD.
%
%  Input arguments:
%  Corresp  - 6xN matrix containing in each column, the 3 projections of
%             the same space point onto the 3 images.
%  CalM     - 9x3 matrix containing the M calibration 3x3 matrices for 
%             each camera concatenated.
%
%  Output arguments: 
%  R_t_2    - 3x4 matrix containing the rotation matrix and translation 
%             vector [R2,t2] for the second camera.
%  R_t_3    - 3x4 matrix containing the rotation matrix and translation 
%             vector [R3,t3] for the third camera.
%  Reconst  - 3xN matrix containing the 3D reconstruction of the
%             correspondences.
%  T        - 3x3x3 array containing the trifocal tensor associated to 
%             this triplet of cameras.
%  iter     - number of iterations needed in estimation (always 0)
